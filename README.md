## Description

For this challenge we were tasked with building a command-line application that allows users to manage employee data in a MySQL database. The goal was to create a robust system that enables users to perform various operations such as viewing departments, roles, and employees, adding new departments, roles, and employees, updating an employee's role, and exiting the application.  To accomplish this, we utilized Node.js and MySQL as the foundation of the application. The project involved setting up the necessary dependencies, establishing a connection to the MySQL database, and implementing the required functionality using SQL queries.  The application consists of several modules and functions that handle different aspects of the employee management system. We implemented functions to retrieve and display data from the database, as well as functions to add new departments, roles, and employees. Additionally, we included a function to update an employee's role.  This assignment challenged our skills in working with databases, SQL queries, and command-line interfaces. It required us to apply our knowledge of Node.js, MySQL, and query building to build a reliable and user-friendly application. By completing this project, we gained valuable experience in managing data, performing CRUD operations, and building command-line applications.

## Usage

This application can have merit in our lives as students, although most likely not.  It has its niche uses, such as having an accessible way to chain information and manipulate it in a easy to use terminal application.  If I were looking to possibly table workouts, recipes, etc.  This app would be of great use, and of course in a professional setting this is the cornerstone way for companies to store data.  The value is mostly found in the actual knowledge of knowing how to build these complex systems though, it is very marketable as a potential employee.
